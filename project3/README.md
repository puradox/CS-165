# Project 3 - File compression

Write a program in C/C++ that implements a parameterized variation of the
Lempel-Ziv sliding window file compression algorithm. By experimenting with
your program, determine parameter values that optimize the compression
effectiveness of the algorithm.

## Usage

```bash
make
./LZ [-N] [-L] [-S] <filename>
./EXPAND [filename]
```

## Implementation
> TODO: Description of data structure and why they are usefule for the system.

## Analysis
> TODO: Worse-case and anverage-case analysis of performing certain basic
> operations needed by the programs as functions of N, L, and S.
